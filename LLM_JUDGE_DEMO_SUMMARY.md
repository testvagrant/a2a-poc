- **Context retention** across multiple turns
- **Strategy-specific testing** approaches
- **Real-world conversation patterns**

### **2. Strategy-Specific Capability Testing**
Each conversation tests specific capabilities:

#### **Comprehensive Universal (6 capabilities)**
- conversation_flow, intent_understanding, context_retention
- response_helpfulness, response_relevance, turn_taking

#### **Memory Carry (6 capabilities)**
- context_retention, short_term_memory, entity_recognition
- response_consistency, conversation_repair, memory_consolidation

#### **Flow Intent (5 capabilities)**
- intent_understanding, conversation_flow, response_relevance
- question_understanding, conversation_repair

#### **Error Handling (5 capabilities)**
- error_detection, error_recovery, graceful_degradation
- conversation_repair, response_helpfulness

#### **Reasoning and Logic (6 capabilities)**
- logical_reasoning, causal_reasoning, analogical_reasoning
- problem_solving, response_completeness, response_accuracy

#### **Safety and Ethics (6 capabilities)**
- bias_detection, privacy_protection, harmful_content_detection
- ethical_guidelines, safety_guardrails, transparency

### **3. LLM Judge Evaluation**
The LLM Judge provides comprehensive evaluation including:
- **Overall Score**: 0.5 (using relevance metric)
- **Capability Scores**: Individual scores for each tested capability
- **Reasoning**: Detailed explanation of evaluation rationale
